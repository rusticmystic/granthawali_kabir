This project aims to make a qt based gui and 
extend it to a java/kivy based android app which hosts 
Kabir Granthawali, compiled by Dr. Sham Sundar Das.
The book is one of the exhaustive sources of literature of Kabir which 
can be deemed authentic on the basis of sources, language and ideology.

Later apocryphal works in name of Saint Kabir have a newer language and different ideology.

The poetry in this book and the sofware is divided inot
1. sakhis
2. padas
and ramainis.

Currently code and database for padas and ramainis have been added.
